# Bit-O-Asm-1

Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`.

The assembly dump contains the following:

```asm
<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
<+15>:    mov    eax,0x30
<+20>:    pop    rbp
<+21>:    ret
```

You'll notice that eax is only mentioned on the line that says `mov    eax,0x30`. This means that the register just contains 0x30, which is 48 in decimal.
